# JumpShift-A-16-Bit-Quest 

JumpShift is a 16-bit endless runner where the world defies your existence, standing against you pushing you to give up on chasing the stars.

Dodge obstacles, jump with precision and reshape the very core of the game's world to your advantage. Master the art of gravity manipulation to defy all odds and survive as long as you can.

## Story (Spoiler less)

The game starts with a man running away holding a sword in this right hand. He jumps from objects to objects escaping an unknown shadowy entity. This entity however is not visible to player himself. The game progresses as you keep running away from an entity that you do not see yourself.

The man was named Claid and he is running relentlessly showcasing his proficiency in running and parkour. He falls many times but he feels no pain doesn't die but the shadowy entity eliminates him. Does he die? No. He simply begins again. Initially he asked himself, "Why am I not dying? Was that a dream?" before he starts running away from the shadowy figure again but over the span of time he has given up. Given up looking for answers about this mysterious world where death and pain doesn't exist.

"I am running... running away." that was the last thing in his memory. "But from what?", His throat was dry from the same question, yet no answer ever reached it.
